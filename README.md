# Beautiful Text Editor

A simple, modern, and responsive text editor built using Python and Tkinter. This text editor allows you to create, open, save, and edit text files with a clean and minimalistic user interface. It supports basic functionality like keyboard shortcuts and a status bar that updates based on user actions.

## Features

- **Create New Files**: Clear the editor to start a new file.
- **Open Files**: Open existing `.txt` files from your system.
- **Save Files**: Save your work to a `.txt` file.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Supports `Ctrl + N` (New), `Ctrl + O` (Open), and `Ctrl + S` (Save).
- **Status Bar**: Displays helpful messages at the bottom (e.g., file opened, file saved).
- **Responsive UI**: The editor adjusts automatically to window resizing.

## Installation

To run the text editor, you need Python and Tkinter installed on your machine. Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python, so you may not need to install it separately.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure that you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
2. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is typically bundled with Python, but if it's not installed, you can install it via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```
